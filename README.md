Are you interested in running but don’t know where to begin? Or are you an experienced runner that can’t seem to find a running group that meets at the right time or place? 

Chicago running groups lack a variety of dates/times, location and flexibility in running ability.

Here at **"runCHI"**, we have created an application that allows users to add and sign up for running groups in a variety of locations. runCHI helps everyday runners connect with other runners in their area and at their level.

**According to research conducted by Fleet Feet Chicago,...**

Chicago runners come from a VARIETY of locations, therefore, running groups in various locations would help ease the pain of navigating all over the city just to go for a run.
